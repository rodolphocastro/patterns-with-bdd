# BddPatterns

## 💥 What is this?

This repository is a playground to mess with Patterns (Design, Architectural and more) and the BDD mindset.

## 👨‍💻 Tech Stack for this Project

### ⚒ High Level Frameworks

+ [SpecFlow](https://specflow.org/) - Gherkin bindings for .NET
+ [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) - Unit Testing Framework

### 📦 NuGets and Libraries

Those are some of the main libraries used, if you want to see (in details) all of them you'll need to load this baby up on VisualStudio.

## ⚙ Building and Testing

Basically all you need is .NET 5 SDK, then `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` the `.sln` file.

If you're interested in CICD goodies, take a glance @ [the pipeline files](.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml).
